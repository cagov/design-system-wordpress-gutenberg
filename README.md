# Gutenberg Block plugin README

## CA.gov Design System Gutenberg Blocks

Version 2.0.0
`@cagov/design-system-wordpress-gutenberg`

Integrates the [State of California Design System](https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov) into the WordPress Gutenberg editor.

The [CA.gov](http://CA.gov) design system defines “Content Components”. This can be structured markup with CSS and custom elements, or interactive web components.

[Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) is the open-source editor that is included in core WordPress, version 5.0 and later. It allows content editors to use pre-defined markup blocks in content.

This plugin includes only Content components from the Design System.

This plugin is the official and tested set of block plugins for the core design system.

This plugin is still in beta while the newly established design system is adopted. 

We are discussing a working-group and governance team to assist with guidance and coordination on the future of this block library.

## Custom Gutenberg blocks

If you would like to add additional Gutenberg blocks to your project, you can do this similarly to how we have implemented it for the Department of Cannabis Control website.
